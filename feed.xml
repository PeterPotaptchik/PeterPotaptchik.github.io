Action Matching proposes to choose \(v_t\) to be the unique gradient field (of the form \(\nabla s_t\)) in each case. The paper provides tractable objectives (if one can sample from \(q_t\)), extensions, and connections to optimal transport.</p> <h2 id="continuity-equation">Continuity Equation</h2> <p>Suppose that we have a continuous path of densities \((q_t)_{t \geq 0}\). We may want a vector field that pushes particles to follow these densities. In particular, suppose that a particle is initialized as \(x_0 \sim q_0\). We can evolve the particle to follow some time-dependent vector field \(v_t\) as follows</p> \[\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = v_t(x(t)), \quad x(0) = x_0.\] <p>The densities \(q_t\) are equal to the laws of \(x(t)\) iff the <em>continuity equation</em> holds:</p> \[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}q_t(x) = - \text{div}(q_t v_t)(x) = - \nabla \cdot (q_t v_t)(x).\] <p>Recall the intuition that \(\text{div}(q_t v_t)(x)\) tells us how much outward flow the density-weighted vector field \(v_t q_t\) induces at a point \(x\), and so the density will change opposite to that.</p> <h2 id="helmholtz-decomposition">Helmholtz Decomposition</h2> <p>The standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_decomposition">Helmholtz Decomposition</a> states that a vector field \(v\) can be decomposed as</p> \[\begin{aligned} v(x) &amp;= \nabla s(x) + w(x), \\ \text{div}(w)(x) &amp;= 0. \end{aligned}\] <p>In particular, this means that \(v\) can be written as the sum of a gradient field \(\nabla s\) and a divergence-free term \(w\). Under some conditions, the decomposition is unique (up to a constant for \(s\)).</p> <p>This result can be extended to consider the divergence operator with respect to some density \(q\). In particular, any vector field \(v\) can be uniquely decomposed as</p> \[v(x) = \nabla s(x) + w(x)\] <p>where \(w\) is divergence free w.r.t. \(q\) in the sense that \(\text{div}(qw)(x) = 0\).</p> <h2 id="action-matching">Action Matching</h2> <p>For a given path of densities \(q_t\), there are many vector fields \(v_t\) that will satisfy the continuity equation, and thus keep the dynamics evolving as \(q_t\). In particular, adding any \(a_t\) to \(v_t\) such that \(\text{div}(q_ta_t) = 0\) will still satisfy the continuity equation.</p> <p>However, the Helmholtz Decomposition tells us that all \(v_t\) that satisfy the continuity equation will have the same unique gradient field \(\nabla s_t\). In particular, if \(v^{(1)}_t, v^{(2)}_t\) both satisfy the continuity equation and their Helmholtz Decompositions are \(v^{(i)}_t = \nabla s^{(i)}_t + w^{(i)}_t\), then</p> \[\begin{aligned} 0 &amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(q_t-q_t) \\ &amp;= \text{div}(q_t(\nabla s^{(1)}_t-\nabla s^{(2)}_t)) + \text{div}(q_tw^{(1)}_t) -\text{div}(q_tw^{(2)}_t) \\ &amp;= \text{div}(q_t(\nabla s^{(1)}_t-\nabla s^{(2)}_t)) + 0 - 0. \end{aligned}\] <p>Hence, the Helmholtz Decomposition is unique only if \(\nabla s^{(1)}_t-\nabla s^{(2)}_t = 0\). Otherwise, we could add and subtract a multiple of \(\nabla s^{(1)}_t-\nabla s^{(2)}_t\) from \(\nabla s^{(i)}_t\) and \(w^{(i)}_t\) respectively, without changing \(v^{(i)}_t\).</p> <p>Therefore Action Matching (AM) suggests choosing \(v_t\) in a canonical way, by setting \(v_t = \nabla s_t\), the unique gradient field satisfying the continuity equation. The scalar function \(s_t\) (unique up to a constant) is called the <em>action</em>.</p> <p>Theorem 2.2 provides a tractable objective for learning an approximation \(\hat{s}_t\) to the true action \(s_t\). Once \(\hat{s}_t\) is trained, sampling can be performed by evolving an ODE as follows:</p> \[\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = \nabla \hat{s}_t(x(t)), \quad x(0) \sim q_0.\] <h2 id="extensions">Extensions</h2> <p>The paper also introduces entropic Action Matching (eAM). Instead of evolving an ODE to satisfy the dynamics \(q_t\), one could also evolve an SDE:</p> \[dX(t) = v_t(X(t))dt + \sigma_t dB_t, \quad X(0) \sim q_0.\] <p>The evolution of such a density is characterized by the Fokker-Planck equation which states that the law of \(X(t)\) has density \(q_t\) iff</p> \[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}q_t = - \text{div}(q_t v_t) + \frac{\sigma_t^2}{2}\Delta q_t.\] <p>The intuition behind \(\frac{\sigma_t^2}{2}\Delta q_t\) is that the Laplacian \(\Delta q_t(x)\) tells us how much more density there is around a point \(x\) than at \(x\). So, if this value is high, the diffusion will increase the amount of density at \(x\).</p> <p>Fixing \(\sigma_t\), there are once again many different \(v_t\) that satisfy the above (we can add any divergence-free term to \(v_t\)). However, eAM suggests choosing \(v_t\) to be the unique scalar field \(v_t = \nabla s_t\) that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation. Proposition 3.2 provides a tractable objective.</p> <p>The paper also introduces unbalanced Action Matching where particles can be created and destroyed according to some growth rate \(g_t(x)\) for position \(x\) at time \(t\). Such dynamics are governed by the ODE \(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} q_t = - \text{div}(q_t v_t) + q_t g_t\).</p> <p>The paper extends AM to more general convex costs and discusses connections to optimal transport.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notes on Action Matching]]></summary></entry></feed>
