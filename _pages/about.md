I'm a second-year DPhil student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of [George Deligiannidis](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/), [Saifuddin Syed](https://www.saifsyed.com/) and [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/). My studies are funded by the [StatML CDT](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/statistics-machine-learning).

My research centers on generative modelling and sampling, with a focus on bridging various fields. I’m particularly interested in using techniques from differential geometry, optimal transport, probability, and statistical learning theory to deepen our understanding of the strengths and limitations of algorithms in these areas. I also have a broader interest in machine learning theory

Before joining Oxford, I worked with [Chris J. Maddison](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cmaddis/) and [Daniel Roy](http://danroy.org/) at the University of Toronto, where I earned my BSc in Computer Science and Statistics.
